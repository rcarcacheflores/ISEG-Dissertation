# ISEG-Dissertation

![logo1](assets/pls_tvar.png)


This repository is dedicated to posting the data and Jupyter notebooks used in my dissertation for the Actuarial Science MSc at ISEG, University of Lisbon. The main objective of this dissertation is to use copulas to model dependencies in counts and severities for TSA claims, during the years 2007-2015. The end product was the simulation of risk measures, such as the TVaR you see above, for risks like the passenger property losses. The folders in this repository mirror the following chapters of my dissertation:

**Chapter 3: Methods and Data**

**Chapter 4: Univariate Data Analysis**

**Chapter 5: Models for Claim Dependence**

Some of the code may not be "Pythonic", but if you have any questions feel free to get in touch. I will post the PDF of the dissertation in the next few weeks, along with a LaTex citation.

Best,
